            <h2>Idea of <span class="text-webf">&lt;web/F&gt;</span></h2>

            <p class="about-panel-content">
                Web is very big, beyond the capacity of any one person to comprehend it.
                Started out as a simple document sharing platform, it rapidly became the communication standard for the world.
                Static content was replaced by dynamic content.
                What once were simple websites, are now complex web applications.
                Web is not one single technology.
                It is a mix of hardware, networks, protocols and lots more.
                However, one aspect of web did not receive the attention as it should have.
                That one aspect is the User Interface Engineering.
                Other than handful of computer engineers,
                web is being used by billions of people without having any formal knowledge of computer science.
                For these users, web is one black box that does things magically.
                All they have is access to web user interface in the form of websites and web applications.
                But still, front-end as an engineering discipline did not get its due respect, especially in project planning.
                There were few who gave their energy and efforts to keep the front-end revolution moving.
                And we are starting  <span class="text-webf">&lt;web/F&gt;</span> as one such effort that’s non-profit;
                so that you can enjoy unbiased technology views.

                <br /><br />
                <span class="text-italic text-underline">
                    Side note: <span class="text-webf">&lt;web/F&gt; </span>started as non-profit and <span class="text-bold">non-sponsored</span>.
                    But very soon we learned that we will need sponsors if we wish to scale WebF.
                    Without sponsors, it is not possible to arrange big events and workshops.
                    We take sponsorship but we have limited it to reserved seats and banners only.
                    We do dot promote any sort of sponsors agenda.
                </span>

        <div>
            <h2>Meaning of <span class="text-webf">&lt;web/F&gt;</span></h2>

            <div class="about-panel-content">
                <p>
                    We focus only on the front-end part of the web.
                    That is why <span class="text-no-break text-webf">'web-slash-f'</span> or simply <span class="text-webf">&lt;web/F&gt;</span>.
                    It is our fundamental belief that building a user interface is not as easy as it is generally assumed to be.
                    Just like any other software engineering activity, building a better user interface is software engineering process.
                    It needs a discipline, clear thought, future vision and a caring attitude towards application users.
                    That is why we call it front-end engineering.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <span class="text-webf">&lt;web/F&gt;</span> is here
                    to highlight the need for specialization in User Interface Development,
                    including the front-end design in project planning,
                    spreading awareness about the un-parallel challenges this work carries and more importantly,
                    building the much deserved respect for UI Engineering in the world of Software Development.
